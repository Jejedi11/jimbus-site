## Styles update

I refreshed `styles/main.css` to provide a modern, responsive layout:

- improved typography and base reset
- sticky header with pill-style nav links and hover/focus states
- hero/banner card with responsive image and text
- container max-width, spacing utilities, and accessible focus outlines
- responsive media queries for phones and tablets

To preview locally, open `index.html` in a browser or serve the folder with a simple HTTP server, for example:

```bash
# Python 3 built-in server (runs at http://localhost:8000)
python3 -m http.server
```

Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser and navigate to `index.html`.
